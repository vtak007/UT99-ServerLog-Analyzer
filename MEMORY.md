# UT99 ServerLog Analyzer — Project Memory

Persistent notes for this project. Read at the start of every session.
See `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific details.

## CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSES

- **Player "connects" ≠ churn.** In UT99 every map travel forces a client reconnect, so a
  `NetComeGo Open` (and a matching NPLoader `Player Join`) fires per map round plus any mid-game
  rejoin. A high per-player connect count is normal for someone who played all evening. Real
  churn = many connects with consistently SHORT sessions (heuristic: Joins≥5 AND AvgSec<60).
  Use **Total time** / **peak concurrent** / **unique players** as the true population measures,
  not raw connect counts.

## RULED-OUT THEORIES

## PROJECT CONVENTIONS

- WinSCP saved session name is `FMJ FTP Server` (shared with UT99 ChatLog Analyzer).
- Remote log is `/System/server-old.log`; `DeleteAfterDownload=$false` (never delete it).
- Downloaded log and report both go to `D:\Dropbox\Gaming\UTLogs\ServerLogs` (NOT `_system`).
- Report/log filename date = the log's "Log file open" session date, not the run date.
- Analysis is AI-assisted: a deterministic deduped **digest** (not raw lines) is sent to the
  Anthropic API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`); `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is a User env var.
- Docs (`README.md`) are finalized only after a live end-to-end test + explicit approval.
- Scheduled task runs daily at **05:00** (server boots 02:00–05:00, creating the log). Retry
  is Task Scheduler restart-on-failure: 30-min interval × 12. `RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable` is
  intentionally OFF so a no-network start still runs, fails fast (exit 1), and restarts — this
  covers both "log not created yet" and "no network" with one mechanism.
- Task principal is **S4U + RunLevel Highest** ("run whether logged on or not" + "run with
  highest privileges"), matching the working `UT99 Chat Monitor - Daily` task. Registering
  S4U/Highest **requires an elevated (Run as Administrator) session** — a normal shell returns
  "Access is denied". GOTCHA: `Register-DailyTask.ps1` unregisters the old task *before*
  creating the new one, so a failed elevated step leaves NO task. Register it from an elevated
  pwsh (or via `Start-Process -Verb RunAs`, which triggers a UAC prompt).

## CHANGE LOG

Newest first. Format: `- YYYY-MM-DD — what changed`.

- 2026-08-03 — User signed off. Wrote README.md, added .gitignore (ignores State/Runlogs/*.xml/
  *.ini), created private local + remote GitHub repo, initial commit + push.
- 2026-08-03 — Task registered S4U + RunLevel Highest (run whether logged on or not + highest
  privileges) via elevated shell, matching the ChatLog task.
- 2026-08-03 — Added features 1–3: trend/NEW-signature diffing (`State\digest-history.json`,
  Get-Trend/Save-DigestHistory), per-map issue attribution (active-map tracking + Issues-by-Map
  table + `{on <map>}` in the API digest), and connection/player analytics (NPLoader name↔ip:port
  pairing, connection-index session pairing, per-player connects/avg/total time, peak concurrent,
  churn heuristic). Documented deferred features 4–9 in `FUTURE-FEATURES.md`. Scheduled task set
  to 05:00 with 30-min restart-on-failure ×12; S4U re-registration pending user go-ahead.
- 2026-08-03 — Initial build: config.ps1, main pipeline (fetch/digest/analysis/report),
  Setup.ps1, Register-DailyTask.ps1, CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md. Verified offline parse + full
  Claude analysis against `FMJ Server Log 2026-08-02.log`. Live WinSCP fetch not yet tested.
